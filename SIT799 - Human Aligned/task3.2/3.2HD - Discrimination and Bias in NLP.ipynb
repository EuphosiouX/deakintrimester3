In addition to learning about the topic of debiasing, this exercise will also help hone your intuition about what word vectors are doing.

You will first compute a vector $g = e_{woman}-e_{man}$, where $e_{woman}$ represents the word vector corresponding to the word *woman*, and $e_{man}$ corresponds to the word vector corresponding to the word *man*. The resulting vector $g$ roughly encodes the concept of \"gender\". (You might get a more accurate representation if you compute $g_1 = e_{mother}-e_{father}$, $g_2 = e_{girl}-e_{boy}$, etc. and average over them.

For example, one weakness of this implementation was that the bias direction $g$ was defined using only the pair of words _woman_ and _man_. As discussed earlier, if $g$ were defined by computing $g_1 = e_{woman} - e_{man}$; $g_2 = e_{mother} - e_{father}$; $g_3 = e_{girl} - e_{boy}$; and so on and averaging over them, you would obtain a better estimate of the \"gender\" dimension in the 50 dimensional word embedding space.

    "The method above introduced by Bolukbasi et al. 2016 is a method to debias embeddings by removing components that lie in stereotype-related embedding subspaces. They demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by removing gender bias from word2vec embeddings, preserving the utility of embeddings and potentially alleviating biases in downstream tasks. However, this method was only for binary labels (e.g., male/female), whereas most real-world demographic attributes, including gender, race, religion, are not binary but continuous or categorical, with more than two categories.\n",
